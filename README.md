# Flights Delay Prediction

The problem consists in predicting the probability of delay of the flights that land or take off from the airport of Santiago de Chile (SCL). For that, I have cleaned, updated dataset. I have analyzed data distribution, performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for producing insights from data. Estimated the likelihood of flight delay using XGBoost Regression model with loss less than 1.5. For predicting whether flights might get delayed or not, Decision tree classifier, Random forest classifier, XGBoost classifiers are used. F1-score metrics is used for evaluation, to measure the performance of models.
