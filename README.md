# Flights Delay Prediction

## Overview

The flight delay can cause airline companies many losses such as 
* Financial losses
* Dissatisfaction among passengers
* Time losses
* Loss of reputation
If an airline doesn't deal with this problem immediately, it will cause other problems. There can be many reasons that causes flight delays such as weather, location, peak season, period of day, and many more. A machine learning prediction model is an indespensable tool to help airlines to predict the flight delay in minutes after departure based on real-time flight data. A classsifer first predicts whether the flight will be delayed or not, and subsequently a regression model predicts the arrival delay in minutes if flight is expected to be delayed.

## Goals

* Identify the factors that causes flight delays using Eploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Built a predictive model (classifier) for predicting whether the flight will get delayed or not.
* Built a regression model for estimating arrival delay in minutes, if flight is expected to be delayed.

## Datasets
Used LATAM Airlines data of flight delay. 

## Practical Applications

* If the reason for flight delay is identified then airlines compnaies can eliminate it or find the solution of it, which will save the company from financial losses and its reputation among the market. 
* An effective prediction of flight delays will not only reduce the economic losses caused by airline delays, but also reduce the stay time and improve the traveling satisfaction of passengers.
